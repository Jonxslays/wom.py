# Migrating to V1

When upgrading from a pre `v1` version to `v1.*.*` there are some breaking
changes to take into account.

If you use any of the below methods you will want to change your usage to
match the **After** example.

## Enums

All skills, bosses, activities, and computed metrics were added to the
[`Metric`][wom.Metric] enum for ease of access from a single source.

The following enums were converted into frozen sets containing the various
[`Metrics`][wom.Metric] they encompass so that you can still easily check
if a metric is a skill, or boss, etc.

- [`Skills`][wom.Skills]
- [`Bosses`][wom.Bosses]
- [`Activities`][wom.Activities]
- [`ComputedMetrics`][wom.ComputedMetrics]

This is probably the most wide-spread change of the release and may
affect you in many places like if statements etc. The fix is very easy though,
just convert most if not all of the places you used the old enums to
[`Metric`][wom.Metric].

The `from_str` and `from_str_maybe` methods were removed from the [`Metric`][wom.Metric] enum.

**Before**

```py
print(wom.Skills.Attack)
print(wom.Bosses.Zulrah)
print(wom.Activities.LastManStanding)
print(wom.ComputedMetrics.Ehp)

slayer = wom.Skills.Slayer
assert slayer in wom.Skills
```

**After**

```py
print(wom.Metric.Attack)
print(wom.Metric.Zulrah)
print(wom.Metric.LastManStanding)
print(wom.Metric.Ehp)

slayer = wom.Metric.Slayer
assert slayer in wom.Skills
```

## Players
