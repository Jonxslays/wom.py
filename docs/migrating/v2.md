# Migrating to V2

When upgrading from `v1` to `v2.*` the only breaking change to take
into account is that support for Python 3.8 has been dropped.

Additionally the minimum required version of the msgspec dependency
is now 0.19.0 - which may be breaking for some users on a lower version.
This change was made to support Python 3.13.
